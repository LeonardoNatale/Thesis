A parametric model is developed and fitted to the Serie B (season 2017/2018 - round A) Italian basketball league. The technique is based on a Poisson regression model developed by Maher in 1982 and enhanced by Dixon and Coles in 1997, which is then adapted to basketball data. Four different models are built, one for each quarter, with the aim of determining the team that scored the most points in a basketball game. The model is shown to accurately predict the result of the last 24 league matches.
